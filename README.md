# AI Image Wildfire Detection

This research focuses on early wildfire detection using AI-based image classification. The research explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically distinguish between images of fire, smoke, and non-fire scenes. The goal is to enable rapid, accurate detection of wildfires from images, supporting real-time monitoring and emergency response.

## Project Structure

- **Research Paper:**  
  The full research and methodology are documented in [Early Wildfire Detection Using AI-Based Image Classification.pdf](Early%20Wildfire%20Detection%20Using%20AI-Based%20Image%20Classification.pdf).  
  This PDF details the problem statement, dataset preparation, model architectures, experimental results, and conclusions. It is the primary source for understanding the scientific background and findings of this project.

- **Code Implementation:**  
  The main code for data processing, model training, evaluation, and visualization is provided in [classifier.ipynb](classifier.ipynb).  
  This Jupyter notebook walks through:
